## Project description
A few weeks ago I came in contact with an architect studio through a friend of mine. They need help fixing a virus-infected computer. After removing the virus and recovering all their missing data, they asked if I knew how to make websites. 
It was a happy coincidence because website is exactly what I have to do as the last course project.

We had a short talk about what they want on the site, but next week I am going to see them again and get a complete picture of what they want.

What I don know so far is that they want: 

  - A fresh, clean and modern website.
  - A page/pages with projects done including images of mentioned projects.
  - A pages with photos and descriptions of each person working at the studio and perhaps projects they have/are working on. (They are 4-5 people).
  - A page citing laws, standards etc. relative to their work 
  - A contact page where I will use a contact form with a php script.
  - A nice intro page before the actual start page opens. (The example they showed me looked like a flash intro, but I will create something similar with CSS3).

They would also like to have the website in both italian and english, but for this project I will only be doing the english version.
  
## Techniques
I will try to only use HTML5 and CSS3 which should be enough for their requirements, though I will use a php script for their mail form. I don't know how to write php script but I have a script that I have used before that will do the job.
I would also like to implement a CMS but I have never done it before so I will need to see what I will need for that.

## Limits
Since I will be using some kind of CMS I will probably have to have some kind of log-in, but I still have to study CMS and understand how it works.

## Preliminary studies
The studio doesn't have any website at present so I will be creating a complete new website for them, but they will show me websites that they like to give me an idea of what visual impact they want to make.

## Changes
I did not integrate a CMS on the site firstly because I didn't have enough time to research CMS since I don't really know how it works. And secondly because CMS might affect SEO which obviously isn't good. So I have to find an alternative.

## Time schedule
Here is a link to the Gantt chart with the project timeline (I used a Gantt template):
